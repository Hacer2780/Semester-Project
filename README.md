# Community Science Museum – Semester Project 1

## Description
This project is a static website built for a fictional science museum. The site is designed to be informative, accessible, and user-friendly. It includes content for children, teachers, and researchers, as well as exhibition overviews, event information, and visitor details.

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## Features
- Fully responsive design for mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Semantic HTML structure with correct use of `<main>`, `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<section>`, and `<footer>`
- Modular CSS architecture (page-specific styles + base `styles.css`)
- Meta descriptions added for SEO
- Accessible navigation (WCAG improvements, proper contrast, labels, and skip links)
- Interactive "Buy Ticket" form with counters
- Course detail pages with form validation
- Hamburger menu with toggle functionality and overlay on small screens
- Footer consistent across all pages with quick links, opening hours, and social media


## Feedback Implemented
✅ CSS files modularized using DRY principles  
✅ Meta descriptions added for all pages  
✅ Mobile image issues fixed using `object-fit: cover` and responsive sizing  
✅ WCAG issues resolved (contrast, labels, form elements)  
✅ All pages updated with `<main>` element and correct semantic tags  
✅ Footer and header unified across all pages  
✅ README and reflection texts updated to match new structure  

## Reflection
This project was significantly improved based on feedback. I completely restructured the HTML to follow semantic and accessible standards. I split CSS into page-specific files and created a shared global stylesheet. Meta tags, proper image handling, and form improvements were applied. Mobile navigation was rebuilt with working toggle states and overlay. The ticket page was made interactive. Each change was carefully documented and committed.
